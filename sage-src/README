The Sage Typechecker and Interpreter.

Available from http://www.cs.ucsc.edu/~kknowles/sage

Disclaimer: This software is a work-in-progress research prototype,
with many rough edges and features which may not work as expected.

Sage is distributed under the GPL as described in the file COPYING, while the
Simplify binaries are distributed under the Java Programming Toolkit software
license, available at http://www.hpl.hp.com/downloads/crl/jtk/agreement.html

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Run "make". If all goes well, you should have a sage executable.

Two copies of the binary executable of the Simplify theorem prover are
included. For sage to run correctly (without the -nosimplify flag), an
executable named "Simplify" must exist.

On Linux, the following should work:

  ln -s Simplify-1.5.4.linux Simplify

On Windows, this is better:

  cp Simplify-1.5.4.exe.win Simplify.exe

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS

To type check and run a program, use "sage <filename>".
A number of example programs are in the "tests" subdirectory.
For example, try "sage tests/polylist.f"

Running "sage -help" shows the command-line options, many of which are
are for debugging purposes.
